# SAS Daily Practice Repository

This repository documents my **structured daily practice in SAS programming**, focusing on data handling, analysis, and reporting workflows commonly used in real-world analytical environments.  
All programs are written with clarity, reproducibility, and good programming practices in mind.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Develop strong foundations in **SAS DATA step and PROC step**
- Practice **data manipulation, summarization, and analysis**
- Understand **statistical outputs and analytical logic**
- Build clean, reusable, and well-documented SAS programs
- Maintain a long-term learning archive for revision and improvement

---

## 📂 Repository Organization

Each **Day folder** reflects the concepts practiced on that day, and file names clearly describe the logic implemented.

## 📊 Data Source
- Public **SAS Coursera practice datasets**
- Used strictly for **learning and demonstration purposes**
- No confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data is included

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- SAS Studio
- Base SAS programming
- GitHub for version control and documentation

---

## 📈 Learning Approach
- Consistent daily practice
- Clear folder and file naming for easy revision
- Emphasis on logic clarity over shortcuts
- Focus on understanding outputs, not just generating them

---

## 📌 Notes
- Outputs are included only when they add analytical or learning value
- Code is intentionally written in a readable and step-by-step manner
- Repository will continue to grow as more advanced concepts are practiced
